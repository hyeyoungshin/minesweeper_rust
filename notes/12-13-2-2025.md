## mod and use
Take a look the following compiler diagnosi:

```
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 | mod board;
  | ---------- previous definition of the module `board` here
3 |
4 | use crate::board;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ `board` reimported here
  ```

>**[Hyeyoung]** I thought `mod board;` and `use crate::board;` serve different purposes. 
>- `mod board;` is declaring/defining a module called "board" 
>- `use crate::board;` is importing the module for use  
>
> This understanding is apparently wrong

>**[Explanation]** 
> `mod board;` does TWO things:
>
> 1. Tells the compiler to look for a file called board.rs (or board/mod.rs)
> 2. makes the module available in the current scope as board
>
> So after `mod board;`, you can already use it as `board::something()`.
>
>`use crate::board;` is about convenience:
>
> It brings the module into scope so you can use shorter names
> But in your case, board is already in scope from `mod board;`!
>
> **What you can do though is bringing specific items into scope:**
>```rust
> mod board;
> use board::Board;  // or use crate::board::Board;
>
>fn main() {
>    let b = Board::new();  // Can use Board directly without prefix
>}
>```
