```rust
struct Board {
    xsize: u32,
    ysize: u32,
    board_map: HashMap<Coordinate, PlayerTile>, 
}
```

We assume `board_map` stores precisely `xsize` * `ysize` entries.

So `board_map.get(&Coordinate{ x, y })` should never return `None`, which means if it does, it's in an error state.
We can handle this by
- `.unwrap()` crashing
- `.expect("err msg")` printing an error message
